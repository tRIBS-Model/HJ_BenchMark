Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator point-scale benchmark</h1>
<p>This repository hosts the setup for executing a point-scale model of
the <a href="https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/site?sitenum=969">Happy
Jack SNOTEL Site</a> in Northern Arizona, USA, using the TIN-Based
Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator (<a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tRIBS</a>). tRIBS v5.2
(or later) uses CMake as a build system, instructions on downloading and
building tRIBS can be found <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Model_Execution.html#compilation-instructions">here</a>.
Or alternatively one may use the tRIBS docker image, more information on
this can be found <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Docker.html#docker">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="model-execution">Model Execution</h2>
<p>From the command line tRIBS can be executed as follows, assuming the
executable is stored in the sub-directory <code>bin</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bin/tRIBS &lt;path/to/infile&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In this case the happy jack input files can be found in
<code>src/in_files/happy_jack.in</code> and can be further modified to
explore tRIBS functionality. Note: the current input file is setup with
relative paths and results will be saved to <code>results/test</code>.
Also, any modification in <code>data/model</code> may require an update
of the .in file.</p>
<h2 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h2>
<p>The benchmark case results are stored as a zip file under
<code>results/reference</code>. These results can be visualized in
comparison to SNOTEL<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

data for the Happy Jack site as demonstrated in the jupyter notebook in
<code>src/tRIBS_snotel_comparison.ipynb</code>.</p>
<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure:</h2>
<h3 id="data">data</h3>
<p>Contains all the necessary data to run tRIBS at Happy Jack and
includes Snotel and SWANN data as a calibration/validation set.</p>
<h3 id="doc">doc</h3>
<p>Contains notebooks for running and analyzing this specific benchmark
case, along side additional documentation.</p>
<h3 id="src">src</h3>
<p>Is designed to contain source code for for the tRIBS executable,
which can be obtained <a
href="https://github.com/tribshms/tRIBS">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bin">bin</h3>
<p>Directory for building and storing tRIBS executable, with
instructions <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Model_Execution.html#compilation-instructions">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="results">results</h3>
<p>Directory for results, with a <em>reference</em> and <em>test</em>
sub-directories. The former contains reference outputs from the Happy
Jack point tRIBS simulation, while the later is empty and intended to
store additional model simulations. Note the main results also contains
a zip of the <em>reference</em> sub-directory.</p>
