Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator basin-scale benchmark</h1>
<p>This repository hosts the setup for executing a basin-scale <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">tRIBS</a> simulation
of the Big Spring watershed, a forested tributary to Sycamore Creek in
Northern Arizona, USA.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-tribs">Obtaining tRIBS</h2>
<p>tRIBS v5.2 (or later) uses CMake as build system, instructions on
downloading and building tRIBS can be found <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Model_Execution.html#compilation-instructions">here</a>.
Or alternatively one may use the tRIBS docker image, more information on
this can be found <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Docker.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="model-execution">Model Execution</h2>
<p>From the command line tRIBS can be executed as follows, assuming the
executable is stored in the sub-directory <code>bin</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bin/tRIBS &lt;path/to/infile&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to run tRIBS in parallel, you will need to
install <a href="https://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a> or a similar
Message Passing Interface, and build the parallel version of tRIBS as
described <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Model_Execution.html#compilation-instructions">here</a>.
In order to run the parallel version of tRIBS, you need to call
<code>mpirun</code> or similar and specify the number of cores required
with the flag -n. The following is an example of this assuming
<code>partRIBS</code> is the parallel build of tRIBS.</p>
<pre><code>mpirun -n 3 bin/partRIBS &lt;path/to/parallel_infile&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The Big Spring serial input file can be found in
<code>src/in_files/big_spring.in</code> and parallel file can be found
in <code>src/in_files/big_spring_par.in</code>. Note: the current input
file is setup with relative paths, any modification in the directories
structure may also require an update of the .in file.</p>
<h2 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h2>
<p>The benchmark case results are stored as a zip file under
<code>results/reference</code> and include sub-directories for both
parallel and serial model runs. These results can be visualized using
the jupyter notebook located in
<code>doc/notebooks/Results.ipynb</code>. In order to run the jupyter
notebook we recommend creating a <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtual
environment</a> using python where you can install additional but
required packages as specified in
<code>doc/notebooks/requirements.text</code>. Note you may also have to
install jupyter in your virtual environment using
<code>pip install jupyterlab</code>.</p>
<h2 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure:</h2>
<h3 id="data">data</h3>
<p>Contains all the necessary data to run tRIBS at Big Spring and
includes graph files for parallel operations. Though additional graph
files can be generated using <a
href="https://github.com/tribshms/MeshBuilder">MeshBuilder</a>.</p>
<h3 id="doc">doc</h3>
<p>Contains Jupyter notebooks for running and analyzing this specific
benchmark case, along side additional documentation.</p>
<h3 id="src">src</h3>
<p>Is designed to contain source code for for the tRIBS executable,
which can be obtained <a
href="https://github.com/tribshms/tRIBS">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="bin">bin</h3>
<p>Directory for building and storing tRIBS executable, with
instructions <a
href="https://tribshms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/Model_Execution.html#compilation-instructions">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="results">results</h3>
<p>Directory for results from Big Spring tRIBS simulation. The
sub-directory references contains additional sub-directories for both
parallel and serial model runs.</p>
