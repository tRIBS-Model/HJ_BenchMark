# TIN-Based Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator single point benchmark

This is an experimental branch of the tRIBS Happy Jack benchmark simulation. The goal here is to use this branch to: 

1. Test updates to tribsDev (and tribshms/tribs_sub2020)
2. Develop scripts that check performance of tRIBS to later be ported to the main branch

**System:**
(1) Anytime working on this project document steps in results/notebook.iynb
(2) Before starting anything run *startup.sh* -- this will update data and results folder (from dropbox) if generated on another computer
(3) At the end of session run *cleanup.sh* -- this will update DropBox with any new results or data and generate a pdf of notebook.iynb in the dated folder (e.g. 8-11-2023)
(4) commit and push at least at the end of every session
